# True History Brewing

## About

This is a website and online storefront I'm currently building for True History, a brewery and taproom in the west-end of Toronto, Ontario. The site is being built using React, Remix, [Hydrogen](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen), and Oxygen as a headless storefront for use with the Shopify CLI. Sanity is also used as a headless CMS.

## Development
I wireframed the project myself using Figma, and am in the development process at the moment, aiming for a projected launch in December 2023. Check back soon.
